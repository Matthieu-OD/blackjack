# blackjack

# Goal
With this project, I want to create a Blackjack game. I would like to do it with fast API for the backend and Svelte on the frontend.

It will depend. I still need to think about how the game will take place in the frontend.

Then I want to create a mobile app from it.


After this project I will work on creating a multiplayer card game with Go and Astro or Nextjs on the frontend.

I will deploy these two apps on my VPS. If I found the project really usefull I might do some youtube videos out of it.
